                                                According to the U.S Bureau of Labor Statistics, college graduates have greater job security, as the unemployment rate is just 4.0% for those with a bachelor’s degree,
                                                versus a rate of 7.5% for those with only a high school diploma.<sup>1</sup>
                                                In addition, the Pew Research Center indicates college graduates tend to have more job satisfaction and they see themselves on a career path, not just working a job.<sup>2</sup></p>

                                                including the job opportunities that will be available in that field and the earning power you may have with that degree.</p>

                                            <p>While college may be a good investment, it’s still important to be sensible about paying for it.
                                                With the average student loan debt at around $35,000, it’s important to make wise borrowing choices.<sup>3</sup>
                                                When taking out student loans, the amount you borrow should stay in proportion to your possible earning potential, so that you have a better opportunity to successfully repay your loan.
                                                We provide worksheets that can help you match up future earnings against the amount borrowed.

                                            <p>As college gets closer, you’ll have more questions every day.
                                                There are a number of people you probably turn to for information: your parents, older siblings, friends, and teachers.
                                                While all these people do have some of the knowledge you’ll need, there’s one more person you should add to the list: your school counselor.</p>
                                            <p>Why get to know your school counselor better? There are many benefits to working with your school counselor, but here are some of the top reasons for spending some time in the counselor’s office:</p>
                                            <h3>Applications</h3>
                                            <p>When it comes to college applications, you’re probably going to have questions.
                                                Your school counselor is a great resource to help you through the process from choosing an essay topic to managing your deadlines.</p>
                                        </div>
                                        <div class="col-sm-4 student4">
                                            <h3>Financial aid</h3>
                                            <p>Navigating the financial aid process is easier if you have a guide.
                                                With a variety of funding sources available (like Pell Grants, institutional aid, and state aid), there are many different factors to consider when determining what might be a good fit for your situation.
                                                Your school counselor can help you explore your options for financing and help answer your questions each step of the way.</p>
                                            <h3>Scholarships</h3>
                                            <p>As you look for ways to cover your college costs, scholarships should be at the top of your list, since it’s money that doesn’t have to be repaid.
                                                But where can you find scholarships? Your school

                                                Your school counselor can also help as you apply for scholarships, answering any questions you may have, making suggestions for essay topic ideas, and more.</p>
                                            <h3>Recommendations</h3>
                                            <p>You’ll find that recommendations are important on the road to college.
                                                Sometimes they’re required as part of your college application and sometimes they’re needed for scholarship applications.
                                                Either way, your school counselor can help you through the process of securing recommendations: who to ask, how to follow up, and more.</p>

                                            <p>As you begin your senior year, college applications should top your list of things to do.
                                                With many of those applications, at least one essay is typically required.
                                                It can seem intimidating at first — where do you begin? And how do you make yourself stand out in the sea of other applicants? Getting advice from people who’ve been there is a good start.</p>
                                            <h2>Our bloggers at the <em>Student LoanDown</em><sup>SM</sup> blog have all been through the college application process, and a few of them have some helpful insights to share when it comes to essays.</h2>
                                            <h3>How to approach essays</h3>
                                            <p>Typically, a college essay is designed to let the admissions officers get to know you and how you think.
                                                College officials who read a lot of essays are likely to spot those that don’t ring true.
                                                With that in mind, remember that some of the best essays are those that are authentic.
                                                Be confident in telling a story that’s really about you, not what you think the admissions office wants to hear.
                                                Everyone has a unique viewpoint to share, so let yours shine through.</p>
                                            <h3>Working wiser</h3>
                                            <p>If you’re applying to several colleges, how can you streamline the work of creating all those essays? It’s </p>

                                            <p>simple: don’t write them all from scratch.
                                                To be more precise, don’t reinvent the wheel with each essay you write.
                                                Take a look at all the applications in front of you, and list the essay topics you’re required to cover for each.
                                                Notice any common themes? If so, it may work to do what one of our bloggers did when she was applying to schools:</p>
                                            <p><em>I ended up writing three basic essays.
                                                    I spent a lot of time on these three essays, and had both my mom and my English teacher review them with me.
                                                    Once these three essays were as well-crafted as I could make them, I re-read the application questions, selected the appropriate essay, and made minor adjustments to customize it to that school’s application.
                                                    By giving myself just a few essays that I could really focus on, I found it much easier to write them well.</em></p>
                                            <h3>Meeting deadlines</h3>
                                            <p>If you have multiple applications and essays to complete, create a schedule for yourself to avoid getting overwhelmed.
                                                Put the due dates for each application on your calendar, and work back from there.
                                                Be sure to note what else is going on around your deadline time.
                                                Do you have important school activities or other obligations the week your application is due? Take time to figure that out now, so you plan your schedule accordingly.
                                                Next, determine your deadlines to have first drafts of your essays completed, and build in some time for re-writing.
                                                If you want anyone to review your essays (especially teachers), be sure to build in at least a week for them to take a look and give you feedback.</p>

                                            <p>While college may be a significant investment for many students, research shows that most college graduates see its benefit.
                                                In fact, 83% of people with a bachelor’s degree feel they’ve already seen the value of their investment in college.<sup>1</sup></p>

                                                Preparing in high school by taking advanced placement or college courses, being active in the community,
                                                or participating in extra-curricular activities can help students start college on the right track.
                                                Taking rigorous math, science, and writing courses can also help.</p>
                                            <h3>Wise study habits</h3>
                                            <p>As many students quickly realize, college will be different from high school.
                                                Your schedule may seem very light at first — you may only be in class for a few hours each day.
                                                The catch is that your professors expect a lot of you outside of class.
                                                There is much more reading, studying, and homework to do than you may be used to.</p>

                                            <ul>
                                                <li><span class="purple-semi">Go to class and actively participate.</span> This is one of the most important things you can do in college.
                                                    Nothing makes up for missing a lecture, not getting notes from a friend, or only reading your textbook.
                                                    Catch the live version and make a point to always show up for class.
                                                    In a large lecture hall, sit near the front if possible — you’ll better hear what the professor is saying and you’re less likely to be distracted.
                                                    When you actively participate in class (by asking and answering questions and taking good notes), you’ll gain a better understanding of the materials and build a better rapport with your professor at the same time.</li>
                                                <li><span class="purple-semi">Review your notes frequently.</span> Take good notes during class, and review them frequently as part of your study routine.
                                                    Don’t wait until the night before a test to take a look at your notes — review them as part of your reading assignment for class.</li>
                                            </ul>

                                                    It may be difficult to catch up and retain the information if you don’t keep up with your assigned reading.
                                                </li>
                                                <li><span class="purple-semi">Study during the day.</span> If you have free time between classes, use it.
                                                    Stay on campus, stake out a spot in the library, and do your work.
                                                    Resist the temptation to head back to your dorm room to sleep or watch TV.
                                                    There are often many distractions during evening study sessions, so try to take care of as many assignments as possible during
                                                    the day.
