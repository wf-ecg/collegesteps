                                                Or perhaps a trade or technical college is the path to your chosen career.</p>

                                            <p>Generally speaking, the more education you get, the higher your earning potential.
                                                In fact, any education beyond high school increases your earning potential significantly.
                                                The chart at the bottom of this page illustrates just how much your earning potential increases with each level of education.</p>

                                            <p>While earning potential is one thing to consider when choosing your career path, there are other important factors as well, such as job security and satisfaction.
                                                As economic conditions change, you want to be in a career that can withstand those changes.</p>

                                            <p>Getting a solid education is a start — college graduates have greater job security than those without a degree.
                                                The unemployment rate is just 3.5% for those with a bachelor’s degree, versus a rate of 6.0% unemployment for those with only a high school diploma.<sup data-footnote="A1">1</sup>
                                                Satisfaction in your career is another important consideration, and college graduates seem to have an edge in that department as well,
                                                seeing themselves on a career path, not just working in a job.<sup data-footnote="A2">2</sup></p>
                                            <h4>Borrow wisely</h4>
                                            <p>While college is a good decision, it’s still important to be sensible about paying for it.
                                                If you plan to borrow for college, it’s critical that you make sensible choices and only borrow what you need.</p>
                                            <p>When taking out student loans, the amount you borrow should stay in proportion to your earning potential,
                                                so you’re in a better position to successfully repay your loan.
                                                We provide worksheets that can help you match up future earnings against the amount borrowed.
                                                (See the <em>“Are you borrowing sensibly?”</em> callout below.) </p>

                                                While it may not be a requirement, depending on the school you’re attending, consider taking the long-term view when making the decision.
                                                You may be planning to attend a school or program that doesn’t require the ACT or SAT now, but if your plans change down the road
                                                and you need these scores for admission, you may be very happy you already took the tests.</p>

                                                The ACT is focused on achievement, measuring the bigger picture of what you’ve learned in school, while the SAT measures aptitude,

                                            <p><b>A.</b> It’s generally advised to take the test no more than three times,
                                                to avoid raising red flags with college admissions counselors.

                                            <p>As many students quickly realize, college will be different from high school.
                                                Your schedule may seem very light at first — you may only be in class for a few hours each day.
                                                The catch is that your professors expect a lot of you outside of class.
                                                There is much more reading, studying, and homework to do than you may be used to from high school.</p>
                                            <p>Because you’ll have so much work to do on your own, you don’t just want to study hard, you’ll want to study smart.
                                                One important way to do that is to match your studying approach to your learning style.
                                                By now, you probably know what helps you learn things best — do flashcards work for you?
                                                Or are you better off discussing the material with a study partner?
                                                Does it help you to draw or map out concepts?
                                                Whatever tactics you’ve found that work for you, keep using them.</p>
                                            <p>Another key component to successful studying is to find the right environment.
                                                Are you easily distracted by others?
                                                Find a quiet corner of the library.
                                                Do you thrive on working with a hum of activity around you?
                                                Study in the student center.
                                                Have trouble sitting still?
                                                Work out before you settle down to study, or plan to concentrate for shorter bursts and take frequent breaks.</p>
                                            <p>The most important thing is to figure out what lets you get the most out of your study sessions.

                                                    In a large lecture hall, sit near the front if possible — you’ll better hear what the professor is saying and you’re less likely to be distracted.
                                                    When you actively participate in class you’ll gain a better understanding of the material and build a better rapport with your professor at the same time.</li>
                                                <li><strong>Review your notes frequently.</strong>
                                                    Take thorough notes during class, and review them frequently as part of your study routine.
                                                    Don’t wait until the night before a test to take a look at your notes — review them as part of your reading assignment for class.</li>
                                                <li><strong>Do the reading.</strong>
                                                    College reading is often assigned in chapters, not pages.
                                                    It may be difficult to catch up and retain the information if you don’t keep up with your assigned reading.</li>

                                                    It’s critical to stay organized and manage your time well during college.
                                                    Find the place where you do your best studying and plan a specific time to be there to get started.
                                                    Keep all your study materials handy, so you’re ready to get started when the time comes.</li>
                                                <li><strong>Sync up your study habits with the ways you learn best.</strong>
                                                    If you’re a person who needs peace and quiet to study, study as much as possible during free time between classes.
                                                    Stay on campus, stake out a spot in the library, and do your work — free from distractions.
                                                    If you’re restless when studying, plan a time and place to study where you can take frequent breaks to get outside,
                                                    or plan your study sessions to directly follow a workout at the gym.
                                                    Whatever your learning style, plan your study sessions to accommodate it.</li>
                                                <li><strong>Avoid all-nighters.</strong>
                                                    While it may seem like a college student’s rite of passage, you don’t have to pull all-nighters studying for tests and working on projects.
