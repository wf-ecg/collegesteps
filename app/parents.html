                                                <h3>College prep</h3>
                                                <p>The summer before college is a busy time.

                                                    Here’s a list to get you both started:</p>

                                            <p><strong>Good study habits.</strong> Some students are able to get by without studying much during high school — but college is a different story. Encourage your student to develop strong study habits during high school and emphasize how important they’ll be in college. Talk about minimizing distractions, building in study breaks, the advantages of reviewing notes frequently, and how to manage their time when completing big projects or studying for big tests.<br />
                                            </p>
                                            <p><strong>Solid note-taking skills.</strong> Keeping up with professors can be a challenge in college. But it’s an important skill to learn, since taking good notes during class is key to doing well. Talk with your student about how they take notes now, and suggest some strategies for coming away from class with a solid set of notes. If you aren’t sure how to help, suggest getting ideas from their teachers about the best way to capture the important ideas from a lecture.</p>
                                            <p><strong>Choosing classes wisely.</strong> Taking advanced placement classes can help students get college credit while they’re still in high school. If it seems like a good fit, encourage your student to take advantage of this opportunity. It will allow them to save money and time during college. Even if they’re able to test out of just one class, it can lighten their course load during that first year and allow them more time to focus on other classes. </p>

                                            <h2>Financial</h2>
                                            <p>When students need money for college, it’s important for them to understand all the details of their financial aid options, including loans, and what their responsibility is to repay. Get your student engaged with paying for college by going over their award letter together, talking through the details of what it means to them, and whether or not any additional funding is needed.</p>
                                            <p><strong>Evaluating tuition costs.</strong> First things first. Every student should know exactly what their tuition costs and what it includes. It can help give them some understanding and appreciation of the value of their education, and of completing their degree in a timely manner.</p>
                                            <p><strong>Understanding award letters.</strong> When your student’s award letter arrives, look it over together and help your student understand what aid they’re being offered to cover their costs. If your student will be borrowing student loans to help pay for college, be sure to discuss the different types of loans available and which type makes the most sense for your student and family.</p>
                                            <p><strong>Learning about student loans.</strong> Help your student get a handle on the details of student loans if they need financing to cover college expenses. Learning the facts about student loans is a great first step to understanding the responsibility of borrowing only what they need, taking thoughtful care of their expenses during college and preparing them to repay their loans once they’ve completed their degree. </p>
                                            <p><strong>Creating a budget.</strong> As you begin to discuss what their finances might look like, it’s a great time to start talking about how to manage their money while they’re in college. Every college student should understand how to track their spending to create a budget. Getting control over their money is a life skill that will serve them throughout college and beyond. You can get the conversation started with helpful tools found on our website at <a href="#">wellsfargo.com/goals-going-to-college/student-budget</a>.</p>

                                            <h2>Practical</h2>
                                            <p>If your student has been more focused on studying and school activities than doing housework, well, they’re not alone. But before they leave for college it’s a good idea to teach your student some practical skills they may need when they’re out on their own. </p>
                                            <p><strong>Mastering the laundry.</strong> Have your student practice a few loads of their own before heading off to college. If they don’t know the basics of separating colors and whites, and simple stain removal techniques, that’s a good place to start. Maybe taking on their own laundry duties for awhile would help them practice and gain some independence before leaving for college.</p>
                                            <p><strong>How to cook.</strong> If your student will be cooking while at college, it’s a must to get the basics down before leaving for school. Put together some simple recipes and let them get some practice. Maybe include some bigger meal ideas as well that they could freeze and eat during the week. </p>
                                            <p><strong>Basic car maintenance.</strong> Most high school students don’t do much car maintenance, so if your student is taking a car to school, a few lessons might be in order. Learning how to check the oil, put air in the tires, jump start a dead battery, change a flat, and add washer fluid are just a few basics that they’ll be glad to know when the time comes. An emergency kit for the trunk also makes a great graduation gift.</p>
                                            <p>Your help and guidance are likely needed as your student prepares for college, so plan to team up on this college-planning journey. As a person just on the cusp of adulthood, your student brings dreams and plans for the future to the table — as a parent, you provide years of life and financial experience to help send them on their way. </p>

                                            <p>The cost of a federal or private student loan is linked to the interest rate, fees, and the loan term, so all of these factors should be carefully considered when reviewing loan options.</p>
                                            <p>The <span class="o-bold">interest rates</span> for federal student loans are set by Congress.
                                                All new federal student loans have a fixed interest rate.

                                                The interest rates for private student loans vary and are based on criteria determined by the lender.
                                                The most common criteria are creditworthiness and income.
                                                Depending on the lender, borrowers may be able to choose a fixed or variable interest rate on their private student loans.
                                                Variable rates may change over the life of the loan, while fixed interest rates remain the same.</p>
                                            <p><span class="o-bold">Fees</span> are costs you have to pay to originate or service your loan.
                                                These are charges you pay in addition to interest.
                                                If you borrow a federal or a private student loan, keep in mind the provider may deduct the fees directly from the original loan amount
                                                — so the amount you receive in your disbursement may appear to be less than the amount you actually borrowed.
                                                However, you are still required to repay the full amount you borrowed and not just the amount you received in your disbursement.</p>
                                            <p><span class="o-bold">Repayment term</span> is the length of time you have to repay your loan.
                                                Before you take out a loan, find out how long you have to pay it back and whether or not there are any prepayment penalties.</p>

                                                Consider the grace period for each loan option so you or your student won’t be surprised when repayment begins.
                                                When examining the repayment of a student loan, many people only look at the estimated payment schedule based on the first year of borrowing.
                                                To get a more realistic idea of the total monthly payments, consider the total amount of student loans borrowed for your student to complete a degree.</p>
