Hello once again,

0:00:16.000 --> 0:00:19.125
it's me, Mr. Fellows, your
favorite College Advisor.

0:00:19.125 --> 0:00:19.917
Today

0:00:19.917 --> 0:00:21.708
Monty and I are very

0:00:21.708 --> 0:00:24.750
excited to tell you all about
Step number 3.

0:00:24.750 --> 0:00:25.750
Isn't that right Monty?

0:00:27.917 --> 0:00:30.542
Anyways, if grants...

0:00:30.542 --> 0:00:32.833
scholarships,
institutional awards...

0:00:33.833 --> 0:00:35.458
Federal Work Study, and
Federal Loans

0:00:35.458 --> 0:00:37.667
covers all your college-related
expenses, then

0:00:39.000 --> 0:00:40.792
that's great!
You're all set.

0:00:40.792 --> 0:00:42.250
But...

0:00:42.250 --> 0:00:43.583
you might have additional costs

0:00:43.583 --> 0:00:45.250
not covered by your
financial aid

0:00:45.250 --> 0:00:48.375
and...well...that's okay.

0:00:48.375 --> 0:00:50.750
I'll help you explore these
other financing options

0:00:50.750 --> 0:00:51.500

0:00:52.375 --> 0:00:54.333
Steps 4 and 5...

0:00:55.708 --> 0:00:56.750
Ah!...

0:00:56.750 --> 0:00:58.167
Whew!...

0:00:59.375 --> 0:01:00.958
Ahh!...

0:01:00.958 --> 0:01:01.833

0:01:01.833 --> 0:01:03.208
It's working out.

0:01:03.208 --> 0:01:04.292
Whooh!...

0:01:04.292 --> 0:01:07.208
And...that is that!

0:01:07.208 --> 0:01:08.167
Ahh!

0:01:08.167 --> 0:01:10.125
And remember what I always
say...

0:01:10.125 --> 0:01:13.292
with college comes great
knowledge.

0:01:13.292 --> 0:01:14.375
Take care!
