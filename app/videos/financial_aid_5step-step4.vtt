0:00:14.833 --> 0:00:16.208
Hello students!

0:00:16.208 --> 0:00:18.833
Mr. Fellows here to tell you
about Step 4

0:00:18.833 --> 0:00:20.833
of the financial aid process...

0:00:20.833 --> 0:00:23.833
tackling additional financing
options that you have.

0:00:31.417 --> 0:00:33.125
Here she goes...

0:00:33.125 --> 0:00:34.125
Whoop!...

0:00:34.125 --> 0:00:36.542
Didn't really give myself
a lot of room...

0:00:36.542 --> 0:00:37.542
Yeah!...

0:00:41.167 --> 0:00:41.875
Okay...

0:00:43.583 --> 0:00:44.833
See ya on the open road.

0:00:47.000 --> 0:00:49.000
Financial Aid!

0:00:49.125 --> 0:00:50.583
Even if you've maximized all of

0:00:50.583 --> 0:00:52.208
your scholarships, grants and

0:00:52.208 --> 0:00:53.125
federal student loans,

0:00:53.125 --> 0:00:55.708
you may still need help
covering college expenses.

0:00:55.708 --> 0:00:57.167
So Monty's gonna tell you
all about

0:00:57.167 --> 0:00:58.500
the additional financing options

0:00:58.500 --> 0:00:59.958
you have available to you.

0:00:59.958 --> 0:01:01.250
Take it away Monty...

0:01:05.625 --> 0:01:07.958
He's more of an ice hockey guy.

0:01:07.958 --> 0:01:11.375
Next, there's the Federal Direct
PLUS loan for parents.

0:01:11.375 --> 0:01:12.833
Now this loan is available for

0:01:12.833 --> 0:01:15.083
parents of dependent
undergraduate students.

0:01:15.083 --> 0:01:17.542
It covers up to 100%,

0:01:17.542 --> 0:01:21.917
yeah, 100% of remaining
education-related expense.

0:01:21.917 --> 0:01:23.708
A credit-check is required,

0:01:23.708 --> 0:01:24.917
but the parents' debt

0:01:24.917 --> 0:01:27.000
and current income is not
considered.

0:01:27.000 --> 0:01:30.958
Also, there's the private or
alternative student loans.

0:01:30.958 --> 0:01:32.792
Now these loans are made
available to students

0:01:32.792 --> 0:01:35.167
through banks and other private
lenders.

0:01:35.167 --> 0:01:36.667
A credit-check is required

0:01:36.667 --> 0:01:38.917
as well as a debt and current
income check.

0:01:38.917 --> 0:01:41.792
Therefore, most students
will need a qualified

0:01:41.792 --> 0:01:46.042
adult wage earning cosigner to
meet eligibility requirements.

0:01:52.375 --> 0:01:53.208
Additionally,

0:01:53.208 --> 0:01:54.292
as a way to better manage

0:01:54.292 --> 0:01:55.792
payment of your outstanding
tuition,

0:01:55.792 --> 0:01:57.583
some schools may allow you
to enroll

0:01:57.583 --> 0:01:59.292
in a tuition payment plan.

0:01:59.292 --> 0:02:01.458
Now this plan will allow you
to make smaller

0:02:01.458 --> 0:02:03.167
and more manageable payments.

0:02:03.167 --> 0:02:05.792
Well, that just about
wraps it up for this step.

0:02:05.792 --> 0:02:07.417
And like I always say...

0:02:07.417 --> 0:02:10.083
with college comes
great knowledge.

0:02:10.083 --> 0:02:11.125
I'll see ya next time!

0:02:13.083 --> 0:02:14.083
