                                            <p>As a college student, taking control of your finances can really be empowering.
                                                You may not have much income at the moment,
                                                but managing your spending now may help set you up with good habits for a lifetime of financial success.</p>
                                            <p>So how do you take control of your money? It does require some time to build a budget,
                                                and some discipline to follow it, but it really starts with the right mindset about money.
                                                Look at money management as a way to stay in charge, so you’re not always wondering where your money went.</p>
                                            <p>Following are some tips that can help you manage your day-to-day expenses, no matter what your budget:</p>
                                            <p><strong>Get the right tools in place.</strong>
                                                Money management starts with a bank account and the tools to help you manage it:</p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Open a checking and savings account with a debit card attached.</li>
                                                <li>Sign up for online banking which allows you to carefully monitor your accounts, transfer funds if needed,
                                                    and use any available budgeting or money management tools.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                            <p><strong>Make a spending plan.</strong>
                                                A spending plan can help you control where your money goes through careful planning.
                                                It puts you in the driver’s seat and allows you to save for the future.
                                                Get started by using the cashflow worksheet and other helpful tools at
                                                <a href="wellsfargo.com/goals-going-to-college/student-budget">wellsfargo.com/goals-going-to-college/student-budget</a>.</p>
                                            <p><strong>Know your priorities.</strong>
                                                Making a spending plan is one thing, sticking to it is another.
                                                When you are clear about your spending priorities,
                                                it helps to keep you from agreeing with every one of your friends’ impromptu suggestions that can cost you money and really add up
                                                (like dining out or going to a movie).
                                                Know what’s important to you and how changes in the plan will impact your financial goals.</p>

                                                        Look for online deals through websites like Groupon or LivingSocial.
                                                        Split meals with a friend, or bring home leftovers for a second meal.</li>
                                                    <li><strong>Ask about student discounts.</strong>
                                                        Some places offer a better deal when you show your student ID.</li>
                                                    <li><strong>Going to the movies?</strong>
                                                        Avoid prime time and save money by going to a cheaper mid-week show, visiting discount movie theaters or going to a matinee.</li>
                                                </ul>
                                                <p>If you can learn to manage your money and stick to a budget while in college,
                                                    you’ll have built some great habits to continue throughout your life.</p>

                                            <p>College students can also begin building credit through careful use of credit cards.
                                                Having a credit card to fall back on in case of an emergency can be helpful,
                                                and using it to make smaller purchases that you pay off on-time every month is
                                                a good way to begin establishing your credit history.</p>

                                                it is important to only borrow what you need and not overextend yourself with too much debt.
                                                Keeping a budget can help you balance what you may need to purchase now using credit,

                                            <p>Credit allows you to buy something now and pay for it later using an account or product to borrow money.
                                                Credit comes in many different forms such as a credit card, a student loan, or a car loan.</p>
                                            <p>In addition to paying back the actual amount you borrow, you pay a cost to borrow the money which is called “interest” or “finance charges.”
                                                Credit products have different interest rates, and the higher the rate, the more interest you will have to pay.</p>

                                                <p>You can ESTABLISH CREDIT by understanding credit and using it responsibly.
                                                    Begin building credit by managing your credit accounts — like credit cards and loans — responsibly and making your payments on time every month.
                                                    Things such as on-time payments and borrowing only what you can repay, are captured and recorded by the credit bureaus (who create credit reports and credit scores).
                                                    Making payments on time helps establish you as a low credit risk and may improve your chances of getting credit in the future.

                                            <h3>Why is credit important?</h3>
                                            <p>People with good credit usually enjoy lower interest rates and greater borrowing power.
                                                And typically, you need to establish credit in order to do basic things such as renting an apartment, or making a major purchase.
                                                Following are just a few of the ways that good credit is important:</p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Good credit is important to secure financing when buying furniture, a computer, a car, or eventually a new home.</li>
                                                <li>Renting an apartment may be easier, as a good credit rating tells landlords that you are a person who’s more likely to pay the rent on time each month.</li>
                                                <li>If you need a loan, lenders may look more favorably upon you if you have a good credit history.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                            <h3>Building and maintaining good credit</h3>
                                            <p>As you can see, your credit profile is important, and should be carefully protected.
                                                With credit comes a big responsibility.</p>
                                            <p><strong>Here’s why:</strong></p>
                                            <p>Everything on your credit accounts is tracked.
                                                When you pay, when you don’t pay. How much you pay, how much you owe.
                                                All of it. So, to build and manage your credit, you have to use it wisely.</p>
                                            <p>The most important thing you will do for your credit history is pay your bills on time, every time.
                                                Putting a reminder on your calendar or phone is a good place to start.
                                                Setting up automatic payments will help ensure your payments are made on time.</p>

                                            <p>Heading off to college is an exciting time.
                                                There is so much to think about: new friends, exciting classes, and a new place to live.
                                                If you’re borrowing money for college, it’s tempting to put aside the thoughts of repaying your student loans one day.</p>
                                            <p>But the idea of repaying your student loans doesn’t have to be intimidating.
                                                Thousands of people successfully pay back their student loans each year.
                                                And planning for it is something that you can start today, instead of waiting until you leave school.</p>
                                            <h3>Build repayment into your college plan</h3>

                                                The first step is to figure out how much money you may need to borrow to cover your education expenses.
                                                Of course, you need to look at your school and living costs during college, as well as your other sources of money to cover these costs.
                                                But you should also consider how much you are likely to earn when you get your first job after college.
                                                The Bureau of Labor and Statistics provides data for the average salary for various careers.
                                                You can use this as a guide to help determine your earning potential.<br>

                                                Compare that monthly payment to the average salary for the field of study you plan to pursue.
                                                Then think about how that monthly payment will fit in with your future budget.</p>
