0:00:00.125 --> 0:00:14.000
♪

0:00:14.000 --> 0:00:17.625
Today marks an important day
in all of our lives.

0:00:17.625 --> 0:00:20.167
This marks the fifth and
final step

0:00:20.167 --> 0:00:22.125
of your financial aid journey.

0:00:22.125 --> 0:00:24.458
Every school may have its own
unique deadlines

0:00:24.458 --> 0:00:25.625
for financial aid,

0:00:25.625 --> 0:00:28.167
so be sure to get all of those
important dates

0:00:28.167 --> 0:00:29.583
from your financial aid office.

0:00:29.583 --> 0:00:30.917
And once you know the dates,

0:00:30.917 --> 0:00:33.500
make sure you understand
and compare

0:00:33.500 --> 0:00:35.500
all of your financing options.

0:00:35.500 --> 0:00:38.375
First, consider all forms
of free aid.

0:00:38.375 --> 0:00:40.875
Sources of free aid include:

0:00:40.875 --> 0:00:43.875
Scholarships that you
don't need to be paid back,

0:00:43.875 --> 0:00:45.000
Grants,

0:00:45.000 --> 0:00:46.458
State Aid,

0:00:46.458 --> 0:00:49.542
and Institutional Aid that comes
directly from your school.

0:00:49.542 --> 0:00:52.042
Second, consider self-help aid.

0:00:52.042 --> 0:00:53.875
These options include the

0:00:53.875 --> 0:00:55.875
Federal Work Study program

0:00:55.875 --> 0:00:57.583
which may help you to find
part-time work

0:00:57.583 --> 0:00:58.833
to help cover costs,

0:00:58.833 --> 0:01:00.375
and the Tuition Payment Plan.

0:01:00.375 --> 0:01:01.875
Your financial aid office can
give you the

0:01:01.875 --> 0:01:03.625
low-down on those options.

0:01:03.625 --> 0:01:04.417
Next,

0:01:04.417 --> 0:01:07.792
consider your "first-choice"
student loan options.

0:01:07.792 --> 0:01:09.542
These include the:

0:01:09.542 --> 0:01:11.583
Federal Perkins Loan, and

0:01:11.583 --> 0:01:13.083
Federal Stafford Loan.

0:01:13.083 --> 0:01:14.625
If you have substantial needs,

0:01:14.625 --> 0:01:16.167
you may qualify for the Perkins
Loan

0:01:16.167 --> 0:01:18.042
and the interest that accrues
on your Stafford Loan

0:01:18.042 --> 0:01:20.458
may be subsidized while
you're attending school.

0:01:20.458 --> 0:01:21.458
Whew!

0:01:21.458 --> 0:01:23.208
Excuse me for a second.

0:01:24.125 --> 0:01:28.333
(gulping sounds)

0:01:28.333 --> 0:01:29.333
Ahh...Whew!

0:01:31.708 --> 0:01:32.625
And finally,

0:01:32.625 --> 0:01:34.458
if you still have remaining
expenses,

0:01:34.458 --> 0:01:36.083
consider these student loans:

0:01:36.083 --> 0:01:39.208
The Direct Federal Plus Loan
can be used by parents to help

0:01:39.208 --> 0:01:41.833
their dependent children
in undergraduate programs.

0:01:41.833 --> 0:01:44.000
And the Plus Loan
can  cover up to

0:01:44.000 --> 0:01:46.708
100% of your remaining
expenses

0:01:46.708 --> 0:01:48.750
and it comes with a
fixed interest rate!

0:01:48.750 --> 0:01:52.542
Also, you may want to consider
a private student loan from:

0:01:52.542 --> 0:01:56.667
your bank, or, another
financial institution.

0:01:56.667 --> 0:01:59.625
Like the Plus Loan, private
loans can cover all of your

0:01:59.625 --> 0:02:02.792
outstanding eligible
education-related expenses.

0:02:03.833 --> 0:02:08.833
Excuse me...um...
I'm getting a little emotional.

0:02:08.833 --> 0:02:11.333
Let me be the first to
congratulate you

0:02:11.333 --> 0:02:12.667
on completing your journey

0:02:12.667 --> 0:02:15.917
through the five steps to
financial aid.

0:02:15.917 --> 0:02:17.167
Best of luck to you

0:02:17.167 --> 0:02:20.375
as you head off into the
horizon to college.

0:02:20.375 --> 0:02:22.250
And always remember...

0:02:22.250 --> 0:02:26.708
with college comes great
knowledge.

0:02:26.708 --> 0:02:28.917
Sign up for the CollegeSTEPS®
program

0:02:28.917 --> 0:02:31.125

throughout the year.
