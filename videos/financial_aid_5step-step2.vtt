0:00:15.917 --> 0:00:19.083
Oh, hi,
Mr. Fellows here once again

0:00:19.083 --> 0:00:21.875
to guide you on the five step
journey to financial aid.

0:00:21.875 --> 0:00:25.625
Today I'm going to talk about
the Net Price Calculator.

0:00:28.167 --> 0:00:29.750
Now, you might be saying to
yourself...

0:00:29.750 --> 0:00:32.500
"But Mr. Fellows, I'm awful
at math."

0:00:32.500 --> 0:00:33.625
That's okay...

0:00:33.625 --> 0:00:36.083
the Net Price Calculator
is so easy,

0:00:36.083 --> 0:00:37.625
even Monty here can do it.

0:00:37.625 --> 0:00:39.167
Ain't that right, Monty?

0:00:39.167 --> 0:00:40.458
Sure is friends!

0:00:41.625 --> 0:00:44.625
You'll want to estimate your
college's approximate costs

0:00:44.625 --> 0:00:46.708
by visiting the Net Price
Calculator

0:00:46.708 --> 0:00:48.083
on your school's website.

0:00:48.083 --> 0:00:50.667
This fancy tool,
just kidding...

0:00:50.667 --> 0:00:54.500
This fancy tool will estimate
the total costs of college

0:00:54.500 --> 0:00:57.333
and help you understand what
types of financing resources

0:00:57.333 --> 0:00:58.542
may be available to you.

0:00:58.542 --> 0:01:01.167
Now don't be afraid to play
around with the variables

0:01:01.167 --> 0:01:03.625
to see how your total cost of
college could change.

0:01:04.292 --> 0:01:05.000
For example,

0:01:05.000 --> 0:01:07.750
look closely at the differences
between living on-campus,

0:01:07.750 --> 0:01:10.292
off-campus, or living at home
with your parents.

0:01:10.292 --> 0:01:11.375
And keep in mind,

0:01:11.375 --> 0:01:13.833
this calculator will only give
you an estimate.

0:01:13.833 --> 0:01:15.917
Your actual costs may vary.

0:01:15.917 --> 0:01:19.042
To find this magical calculator,

0:01:19.042 --> 0:01:19.750
("pirate")

0:01:19.750 --> 0:01:23.417
use the search feature on your
college's website and type in:

0:01:23.417 --> 0:01:26.542
NET...PRICE...CALCULATOR.

0:01:26.542 --> 0:01:27.542
Shhh!

0:01:27.542 --> 0:01:29.667
Sorry.

0:01:29.667 --> 0:01:32.833
Well, that, my friends, just
about wraps it up for Step 2.

0:01:32.833 --> 0:01:34.542
Thank you for watching this
video.

0:01:34.542 --> 0:01:36.208
And remember what I always
say...

0:01:36.208 --> 0:01:39.333
with college comes great
knowledge.

0:01:39.333 --> 0:01:40.250
Take care.

0:01:41.083 --> 0:01:42.708
Sorry again.
