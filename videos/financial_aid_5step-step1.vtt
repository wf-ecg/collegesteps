♪

0:00:17.833 --> 0:00:21.333
Good morning,
it's me, Mr. Fellows,

0:00:21.333 --> 0:00:23.333
your wiser college advisor.

0:00:23.333 --> 0:00:26.000
That's pretty cute actually,
uh anyways

0:00:26.000 --> 0:00:28.000
I'm here to help break down
financial aid

0:00:28.000 --> 0:00:30.333
into five easy to follow steps.

0:00:30.333 --> 0:00:31.167
That way,

0:00:31.167 --> 0:00:34.167
you'll be more informed about
college financing options.

0:00:34.167 --> 0:00:36.292
The first step

0:00:36.292 --> 0:00:38.833
of this journey begins
with the FAFSA.

0:00:38.833 --> 0:00:41.333
And you darn tootin' better be
fillin' out your FAFSA.

0:00:42.042 --> 0:00:44.000
Regardless of your family's
income,

0:00:44.000 --> 0:00:45.958
everyone should complete
the FAFSA.

0:00:46.292 --> 0:00:48.000
What is FAFSA you ask?

0:00:48.000 --> 0:00:49.250
FAFSA stands for:

0:00:49.250 --> 0:00:52.250
Free Application for Federal
Student Aid.

0:00:53.167 --> 0:00:55.667
And if you wish to receive
federal financial aid

0:00:55.667 --> 0:00:57.667
most state and institutional aid

0:00:57.667 --> 0:00:59.333
will require filling out the
FAFSA.

0:00:59.333 --> 0:01:01.167
Now what's great about the FAFSA

0:01:01.167 --> 0:01:02.917
is that the schools you've been
accepted to

0:01:02.917 --> 0:01:05.500
will put together a financial
package for you.

0:01:05.500 --> 0:01:06.667
Spiffy, huh.

0:01:06.667 --> 0:01:08.000
Now, keep in mind

0:01:08.000 --> 0:01:10.125
that the FAFSA application
will require

0:01:10.125 --> 0:01:12.167
family tax and income
information

0:01:12.167 --> 0:01:13.500
from the previous year.

0:01:13.500 --> 0:01:15.958
So you will need your parents'
our guardians' help.

0:01:15.958 --> 0:01:17.833
But, don't take it from me

0:01:17.833 --> 0:01:20.000
here's what my best friend Monty
has to say.

0:01:20.000 --> 0:01:22.042
Hello, Monty here

0:01:22.042 --> 0:01:24.250
to make sure you don't skip
this step.

0:01:24.250 --> 0:01:28.000
Also, remember to look for free
aid like scholarships,

0:01:28.000 --> 0:01:30.750
grants or federal student loans.

0:01:30.750 --> 0:01:34.000
Also, please feel free to join
me for some pig crumpets

0:01:34.000 --> 0:01:36.333
and pig, uh hum...

0:01:36.333 --> 0:01:38.417
Didn't realize you guys were
back on me.

0:01:38.417 --> 0:01:39.667
Now remember students

0:01:39.667 --> 0:01:41.333
the FAFSA will need to be
completed

0:01:41.333 --> 0:01:42.917
each year that you're in school

0:01:42.917 --> 0:01:45.333
in order to be considered for
financial aid.

0:01:45.333 --> 0:01:46.667

0:01:46.667 --> 0:01:48.292

0:01:48.292 --> 0:01:50.458
no earlier than January 1st

0:01:50.458 --> 0:01:52.000
for the upcoming academic year.

0:01:52.417 --> 0:01:53.750
And here's another tip.

0:01:53.750 --> 0:01:55.125
If you haven't already done so

0:01:55.125 --> 0:01:56.833
you'll need to request your
FAFSA

0:01:56.833 --> 0:01:58.417

0:01:58.417 --> 0:01:59.583

0:01:59.583 --> 0:02:03.000

0:02:03.000 --> 0:02:03.792
Also,

0:02:03.792 --> 0:02:05.292

estimate

0:02:05.292 --> 0:02:07.917

qualify for
